I'm a software developer and educator living in Lakewood Ohio.  I've been writing software professionally for over 35 years, and teaching and coaching software developers and software development teams for about 25 years.

I started off programming in the C programming language on UNIX systems (*pre-linux!*), moved to C++, particularly on the Windows operating system. 

Since I had some experience from my UNIX (then Linux) days with the PERL programming language, I found I could make a quick buck in the burgeoning ".com" world building web applications and websites for companies. These were the *salad days* - expectations were low, and they thought we were wizards. Somehow though, all these years later, I am still doing much the same. 

I'm married (27 years!), have two wonderful high-school age children, and two weird but fun cats.
